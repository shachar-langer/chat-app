## Prerequisites

It is optional to configure a PORT environment variable. If no PORT was configured, a default 3000 will be used.

## Installation

Clone this repo and in the project directory run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

## Usage

In the project directory run `yarn run start` to start the application. You should now be able to access it from `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/`. The PORT is the port you configured as an environment variable.
